Don't forget to add .env file with:

    DB_USER=<user>             |
    DB_PWD=<password>          |
    DB_NAME=<database-name>    |
                               |
    PORT=<port-name>           |

This template is mainly a backend template and allows for automatic routing and route protection
for admin, private and public directories

I-Public

    Every file in the public directory are accessible by everybody with
    the url '/public/<file-relative-path-in-public-folder>'

II-private

    Every file in the private direcory are only accessible by connected users with
    the url '/connected/<file-relative-path-in-private-folder>'

III-admin

    Same that for private directory but with admin accounts, url: '/admin/<file-relative-path-in-admin-folder>'

Those files can eventually have supplementary routes if manually added later.

----------- login -----------

Every rejected access falls back on the login page, which is accessible by everybody since in the public folder

----------- admin -----------

You can't sign up for an admin account.
Only super admins with access to the Admins DB table can add and remove admin rights
If someone tries to login, the login first verifies if user is admin and if not, it then verifies
for user account
